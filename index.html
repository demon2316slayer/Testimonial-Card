    <h2 class="testimonial-title kira-title">Such a life changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
    <p class="testimonial-text kira-text">"Before joining the bootcamp I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of the program who could only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project in particular, was outstanding.It took my learning to next level in a way no tutorial could ever have. In fact ive often refrred to it during interviews as an exapmle of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a fullstack developer after receiving multiple offers.100% recommended!"
